## Abstract
A bipartite graph is one wherein we have two different partitions of vertices and we have edges
connecting the two partitions. The two vertex sets are disjoint and independent of each other.
There is no edge between vertices in a set. A complete bipartite graph is one wherein we have
all the vertices in one partition connected to all the other vertices in the opposite partition. The
bipartite graph has growing applications these days starting from ride-sharing platforms to
medical applications and even went on to influence advertisement campaigns online. Here in
our project, we have considered four different algorithms that operate in different conditions
and tabulated our findings to better critic and potentially develop trivial solutions that don’t
tend to affect the overlying architecture of the algorithm. One of the key reasons to analyze
how online algorithms work with a bipartite graph is because of its growing popularity. Almost
any problem that we tend to model can be represented as a graph. The advantage with a graph
is because a graphical representation can help us understand the different variables in play and
how the components in a graph are connected. We also have means of traversing a graph at
ease compared with other data structures. A graphical representation opens doors to many
possibilities and hence bipartite graph is closely studied and implemented. **We will look at all
the algorithms with reference to different ride-sharing scenarios**. The main aim of this paper is
to compare all the algorithms and come up with the most desirable solution that can directly
influence the behaviour of an end-user.
